## Basic Datastructures in R

Because R is a programming language, we first look into
some basic concepts and data structures before diving
into the fun part.

<!-- Open a new R-Script. -->

<!-- R and RStudio -->

<!-- Explanation, shortcut, mac vs pc -->

<!-- Inspired by [learnXinYminutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/r/). -->

### Math with R

```{r}
# comments start in the "#" symbol
# they do nothing
```

<!-- datatypes -->

<!-- executing code -->

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Integer
# Numeric
# Complex 
# Character
# logical
# factor
# The factor class is for categorical data
# Factors can be ordered (like grade levels) or unordered (like gender)
# NULL
```

<!-- variables -->

<!-- intuition -->

```{r}
# allowed names, capitalization

# other ways to assign: =, ->
```

<!-- getting the content of a variable -->

```{r}
# implicitly a shortcut for print(main_character)
main_character
```

<!-- basic math -->

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# + - * / %/% %% 
# NaN
```

### Functions and Vectors

<!-- importance of functions -->

<!-- functions and mathematical functions -->

```{r}
# e.g. sin
sin(1/2 * pi)

```

<!-- `?funktion`, F1 -->

```{r}

```

<!-- everything in R is a vector -->

```{r}
# c for combine or concatenate

```

<!-- vectorisation of operations -->

```{r}

```

The `:` operator and `seq`

```{r}

```

<!-- logical comparisons -->

<!-- also elementwise -->

```{r, eval = FALSE}


```


<!-- periodic reminder: error messages are your friends and completely normal -->

```{r}
# e.g. c(1,2,)

```

<!-- combination of different datatypes -->

```{r}
# implicit

# explicit

```

<!-- write your own first function -->

```{r}
## Everything that does something is a function, everything that exists is an object

# greet
```

### Datastructures

1D, same datatype: **vector**

```{r}
# make vector

# We ask for specific elements by subsetting with square brackets []
# (Note that R starts counting from 1)

# subsetting with logical vector

# or with indices
# which

```

usefull functions for vectors

```{r}
# grab just the first or last few entries in the vector,


# or figure out if a certain value is in the vector


# If an index "goes over" you'll get NA:


# You can find the length of your vector with length()


# You can perform operations on entire vectors or subsets of vectors


# and R has many built-in functions to summarize vectors
# mean, min, max, sum


```

1D, different datatypes: **list**

```{r}
# create list

# single [] subsetting

# double [[]] subsetting

# lists and vectors can have names

# using the names for subsetting
```

2D, same Datentyp: **matrix**

```{r}
# matrix

# Ask for the first row

# Perform operation on the first column

# Ask for a specific cell

# Transpose the whole matrix

# Matrix multiplication

# cbind() sticks vectors together column-wise to make a matrix

# rbind() sticks vectors together row-wise to make a matrix

```

2D, different datatypes: **data.frame**

```{r}
# data.frame

# assign names

```

usefull functions for dataframes

```{r}
# nrow, ncol, dim

# parameter stringsAsFactors

# There are many ways to subset data frames
# See if you can find out what each of these lines does
# dollar

# vector

# character

```

Almost as usefula as `?`: the function `str` for _structure_

```{r}
# str
```

### Die ersten Plots

Scatterplots

```{r}
# def x 1:20

# add noise, call it y

# plot x y

```

With linear regression

```{r}
# model lm

# plot

# abline

```

Curves

```{r}
# curve of sine wave

```

Histogram

```{r}
# e.g. of y

```

Barchart

```{r}
# barchart HP students

```

Add some colors

```{r}
# barplot, df, names.arg, col

```

`par`: _graphical parameters_

The last piechart you will ever need.

```{r}
par(bg = "pink")
cols <- c('#0292D8', '#F7EA39', '#C4B632')
pie(
  c(280, 60, 20),
  init.angle = -50,
  col = cols,
  border = NA, labels = NA
)

legend(1, 1,
       xjust = 0.5,
       yjust = 1,
       fill = cols,
       border = NA,
       legend = c('Sky', 'Sunny side of pyramid', 'Shady side of pyramid')
)
```

<!-- Saving plots and graphic devices -->

```{r}
# e.g. png
# ... Plot code

```

## Project-based Workflow

Important RStudio-Settings

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.show='hold', out.width='50%', fig.cap="RStudio Einstellungen"}
knitr::include_graphics(c("img/RS_settings.png", "img/RS_settings2.png"))
```

## Packages: The Tidyverse

Packages are...

Installing packages

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Installation
install.packages("tidyverse")
# Paket laden
library(tidyverse)
```
