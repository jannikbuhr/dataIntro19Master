## Basic Datastructures in R

Because R is a programming language, we first look into
some basic concepts and data structures before diving
into the fun part.

To test out everything we will learn today yourself, open RStudio,
find the top left corner and click the little document with a plus
icon. From the menu select "R Script"^[For power users: the shortcut
is Ctrl+Shift+N].

This chapter will jump into the basic concepts of the R
programming language and is inspired by
[learnXinYminutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/r/).
It is completely normal that some of the concepts covered
in this section will not appear obvious at first. Programming
languages are not unlike human languages and the computer
will not always understand what you want it to do unless you
use exactly the right grammar and vocabulary. However, R will
sometimes tell you, that it didn't understand you through
`error messages` and it is quite the norm to see them a lot.
Even experienced programmers are very fond of this advice:

### Executing Code in R

The simplest use-case for any programming language is probably just
to use it as a calculator (because that's what computers are,
big calculators). Type the following line in
your R script and then hit Ctrl+Enter to send it to the R console.
This is where your code gets executed.


```r
1 + 1
```

```
## [1] 2
```

You can also type directly in the console and then hit enter to execute,
but in order to keep everything reproducible, we write everything
in the R script file so that we can come back later and execute
the same code to proof that it still works and that for example
our data analysis for an experiment is valid.

Your code can have comments to tell your future self why you wrote
a piece of code the way you did. Any line starting with
the number symbol `#` will be ignored by R.


```r
# This line will be ignored
43 - 1 # as will be the part after this #, but not before it
```

```
## [1] 42
```

### Basic Datatypes

Whole numbers (integer)


```r
1L # denoted by L
```

Numbers (numeric, double)


```r
12
12.5
```

Complex numbers


```r
1 + 3i # denoted by the small i for the imaginary part
```

Text (character, string)


```r
"Harry Potter"
```

Logical values (boolean, logical)


```r
TRUE
FALSE
```

Special types that mix with any other type:


```r
# NULL for no value
NULL

# NA for Not Assigned
NA
```

`NA` is contagious. Any computation involving `NA` will return `NA`
(because R has no way of knowing the answer):


```r
NA + 1
```

```
## [1] NA
```

```r
max(NA, 12, 1)
```

```
## [1] NA
```

Factors (factor) for categorical data.


```r
# Factors can be ordered (like grade levels) or unordered (like gender)
factor(c("m", "f", "f", "d", "m"))
```

```
## [1] m f f d m
## Levels: d f m
```

### Variables

Variables store data. You can think of them as a box with a name in which
you can put stuff. Putting stuff in boxes works via "assignment" and the
operator in R for that looks like this: `<-`. You can either type it
directly or use the handy RStudio shortcut Alt+Minus to insert one into
your code.


```r
name <- "Kvothe"
x <- 12
y <- 14
```

Executing the above code will not give you any output, but when you
use the name of the variable, you can see its content:


```r
x
```

```
## [1] 12
```


```r
name
```

```
## [1] "Kvothe"
```

And you can do operations with those variables:


```r
x + y
```

```
## [1] 26
```

***

> **NOTE**
> Be careful about the order of execution!
> R enables you to work interactively and to execute the code you
> write in your script in any order with Ctrl+Enter, but
> when you execute (source) the whole script, it will
> be executed from top to bottom.

Furthermore, code is not executed again automatically, if you
change some dependency of the expression later on. So the second
assignment to x doesn't change y.


```r
x <- 1
y <- x + 1
x <- 1000
y
```

```
## [1] 2
```

***

Variable names can contain letters (capitalization matters),
numbers (but not as the first character) and underscores `_`.
^[They can also contain dots (`.`), but it is considered bad practice
because it can lead to some confusing edge cases.]


```r
# snake_case
main_character_name <- "Kvothe"

# or camelCase
bookTitle <- "The Name of the Wind"

# you can have numbers in the name
x1 <- 12
x2 <- 13

# There are other ways to assign variables
x3 = 12 # this can be confused with setting parameters in function calls
13 -> x4
```

Typing and executing the name of a variable will implicitly
call the `print`  function on it, which displays its
content in the console.


```r
bookTitle # == print(mainCharacterName)
```

### Math Operators

An operator is a function that is called inline, so it stands
between its arguments, like `+`. R can do standard math and much more.


```r
x1 + x2
12 - 13
13 * 12
10 / 5

12 %/% 5 # integer division
12 %% 5  # modulo (the rest of integer division)

# NaN, Not a Number
0 / 0

10 / 0
Inf
-Inf
```

### Functions and Vectors

Functions are the main workhorses of our data analysis.
There are mathematical functions, like `sin`, `cos` etc.


```r
sin(x = 0)
```

```
## [1] 0
```

The `sin` function takes just one **argument** `x` and returns its sine.

Note, that the `=` inside the function parenthesis
gives `x = 0` to the function and has nothing to do with
any `x` defined outside of the function.
The parameter `x` used in the function is separate from
any `x` you might have defined outside of the function. E.g.


```r
x <- 10
# The sin function uses an x = 0
sin(x = 0)
```

```
## [1] 0
```

```r
# But the other x is still 10!
x
```

```
## [1] 10
```

If you want to know more about a function in R, execute `?` with the function
name or press F1 with your mouse over the function.


```r
?sin
```

This is important {.note}

We can pass arguments by name, or by order of appearance.
This allows us to simplify the previous expression.


```r
sin(x = 12)
```

```
## [1] -0.5365729
```

```r
sin(12)
```

```
## [1] -0.5365729
```

The basic datatypes in R are all vectors, which means they can
contain more than one entry. You can create a vector
by combining things of the same data type with the function `c`
for combine.


```r
x <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6)
x
```

```
## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6
```

The basic mathematical operations in R are vectorized by default
i.e. they are performed on every element of the vector.
Here, every element is multiplied by 2 and the result printed
to the console.


```r
x * 2
```

```
## [1]  2  4  6  8 10 12
```

The original vector `x` was not changed in doing so.


```r
x
```

```
## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6
```

But we could have by assigning the result back to `x`, thus overwriting
its previous content. The right hand side (RHS) is executed first:


```r
x <- x * 2
```

Now `x` changed:


```r
x
```

```
## [1]  2  4  6  8 10 12
```

This line performs vector addition:


```r
c(1,2,3) + c(4,5,6)
```

```
## [1] 5 7 9
```

The `:` operator and `seq` allow us to create vectors
of numbers quite easily:


```r
x <- 1:10
x
```

```
##  [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
```


```r
evenNumbers <- seq(from = 0, to = 10, by = 2)
evenNumbers
```

```
## [1]  0  2  4  6  8 10
```

logical comparisons are vectorized as well return `logical` (`boolean`) vectors


```r
12 < 13
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

```r
answer <- 12 > 13
answer
```

```
## [1] FALSE
```

Most things can be compared


```r
main_character_name == "Kvothe" # TRUE
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

```r
main_character_name ==  bookTitle # FALSE
```

```
## [1] FALSE
```

```r
1 == 1 # TRUE
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

`!` means **not**.


```r
1 != 2
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

There is logical and and or:


```r
# "and" => both need to be TRUE to get TRUE
TRUE & FALSE
```

```
## [1] FALSE
```



```r
# "or"  => only one needs to be TRUE
TRUE | FALSE | FALSE
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

```r
TRUE | TRUE
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

They also work element-wise.


```r
a <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
b <- c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)
a | b
```

```
## [1]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE
```

Periodic reminder: error messages are your friends and completely normal.
This error for example tells you that R expected another argument
to the `c` function because you added another comma:


```r
c(1,2,)
```

```
## Error in c(1, 2, ): argument 3 is empty
```

There are errors, messages and warnings. Your code will not
run to the end if R finds errors, but warnings and messages
are Rs way of telling you, that your code ran but
you might want to double-check if it is doing what you expected it to be doing.


```r
warning("Warnings are often fine!")
```

```
## Warning: Warnings are often fine!
```

```r
message("I am a message")
```

```
## I am a message
```

Combining different datatypes into a vector with the `c` function
will coerce them into the same type, choosing the
one that allows the most operations. It can also be done
explicitly.


```r
# implicit
paste("hello", "world", 13)
```

```
## [1] "hello world 13"
```

```r
# explicit
as.character(13)
```

```
## [1] "13"
```

#### Writing Functions

Everything that does something is a function,
everything that exists is an object.

We can write our own functions (like `sin`)


```r
greet <- function(name) {
  # The variable "text" only exists
  # in the context of this function.
  # It is not visible to the outside world.
  text <- paste("Hello ", name, "!", sep = "")
  return(text)
}
```

Here, I am assigning return value of the function
to the variable `result` and then look at the
content of `result`


```r
result <- greet("Jannik")
```


```r
result
```

```
## [1] "Hello Jannik!"
```


```r
addOne <- function(x) {
  return(x + 1)
}
```

If your function fits on one line, you can leave out the curly braces `{}`.


```r
addOne <- function(x) x + 1
```

If you don't explicitly use the `return()` statement inside
of the function definition, the function
will return the last evaluated line, which is why
both versions of `addOne` above are valid R code and do the same thing.

We use a function by calling it with the required
arguments / parameters:


```r
addOne(x = 1)
```

```
## [1] 2
```

Instead of explicitly stating the parameters with their
names when calling the function, we can also rely on the order
in which a function is expecting the arguments:


```r
addOne(1) # the same as addOne(x = 1)
```

```
## [1] 2
```

### Datastructures

#### 1D, same datatype: **vector**


```r
x <- c("harry", "ron", "hermione")
x
```

```
## [1] "harry"    "ron"      "hermione"
```

Getting specific elements of a vector (or other data structure) is
called subsetting:


```r
# We ask for specific elements by subsetting with square brackets []
# (Note that R starts counting from 1)
x[3]
```

```
## [1] "hermione"
```

```r
x[1:2]
```

```
## [1] "harry" "ron"
```

```r
# subsetting with logical vector
logicalVector <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)

## the next 3 statements do the same thing
x[logicalVector]
```

```
## [1] "harry"    "hermione"
```

```r
# or with indices
x[c(1,3)]
```

```
## [1] "harry"    "hermione"
```

```r
# which
x[which(logicalVector)]
```

```
## [1] "harry"    "hermione"
```

There is a number of useful functions for vectors like:


```r
x <- 1:100

# grab just the first or last few entries in the vector,
head(x)
```

```
## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6
```

```r
tail(x)
```

```
## [1]  95  96  97  98  99 100
```

```r
# or figure out if a certain value is in the vector
any(x == 2)
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

```r
which(x == 2)
```

```
## [1] 2
```

```r
x[which(x == 2)]
```

```
## [1] 2
```

```r
# If an index "goes over" you'll get NA:
x[101]
```

```
## [1] NA
```

```r
# You can find the length of your vector with length()
length(x)
```

```
## [1] 100
```

```r
# You can perform operations on entire vectors or subsets of vectors
# [] for subsetting, get a piece of a vector (or list, or anything else)
# () for order of application and more importantly
# for calling functions

result <- greet("jannik")

x[x %% 2 == 0]
```

```
##  [1]   2   4   6   8  10  12  14  16  18  20  22  24  26  28  30  32  34  36  38
## [20]  40  42  44  46  48  50  52  54  56  58  60  62  64  66  68  70  72  74  76
## [39]  78  80  82  84  86  88  90  92  94  96  98 100
```

```r
# and R has many built-in functions to summarize vectors
# mean, min, max, sum
mean(x)
```

```
## [1] 50.5
```

```r
min(x)
```

```
## [1] 1
```

```r
max(x)
```

```
## [1] 100
```

```r
sum(x)
```

```
## [1] 5050
```


```r
c(1,2,3, "harry", TRUE)
```

```
## [1] "1"     "2"     "3"     "harry" "TRUE"
```

```r
c(1, 2, 3, TRUE)
```

```
## [1] 1 2 3 1
```

```r
mean(x %% 2 == 0)
```

```
## [1] 0.5
```

#### 1D, different datatypes: **list**

Lists


```r
# create list
l1 <- list(1, "harry", TRUE, c(1,2,3) )

# single [] subsetting
l1[1]
```

```
## [[1]]
## [1] 1
```

```r
l1[1:2]
```

```
## [[1]]
## [1] 1
## 
## [[2]]
## [1] "harry"
```

```r
# double [[]] subsetting
l1[[1]]
```

```
## [1] 1
```

```r
# lists and vectors can have names
names(l1) <- c("number", "potter", "bool", "vec")
l1
```

```
## $number
## [1] 1
## 
## $potter
## [1] "harry"
## 
## $bool
## [1] TRUE
## 
## $vec
## [1] 1 2 3
```

```r
# using the names for subsetting
l1$number # same as l1[[1]]
```

```
## [1] 1
```

```r
l1[["number"]]
```

```
## [1] 1
```

```r
l1["number"]
```

```
## $number
## [1] 1
```

#### 2D, same Datentyp: **matrix**


```r
# matrix
# matrix(1:9)
# matrix(1:9, nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE)
m <- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3)

# Ask for the first row
m[1, ]
```

```
## [1] 1 4 7
```

```r
# the first column
m[, 1]
```

```
## [1] 1 2 3
```

```r
# the element in the top right corner
m[1,3]
```

```
## [1] 7
```

```r
# Perform operation on the first column
m[,1] * 2
```

```
## [1] 2 4 6
```

```r
m[,1] <- m[,1] * 2 

m
```

```
##      [,1] [,2] [,3]
## [1,]    2    4    7
## [2,]    4    5    8
## [3,]    6    6    9
```

```r
# Transpose the whole matrix
t(m)
```

```
##      [,1] [,2] [,3]
## [1,]    2    4    6
## [2,]    4    5    6
## [3,]    7    8    9
```

```r
# Matrix multiplication
m %*% m
```

```
##      [,1] [,2] [,3]
## [1,]   62   70  109
## [2,]   76   89  140
## [3,]   90  108  171
```

```r
m <- m * 2

# cbind() sticks vectors together column-wise to make a matrix
cbind(
  1:3,
  c(1,2,42)
)
```

```
##      [,1] [,2]
## [1,]    1    1
## [2,]    2    2
## [3,]    3   42
```

```r
m
```

```
##      [,1] [,2] [,3]
## [1,]    4    8   14
## [2,]    8   10   16
## [3,]   12   12   18
```

```r
# rbind() sticks vectors together row-wise to make a matrix
rbind(
  1:3,
  c(1,2,42)
)
```

```
##      [,1] [,2] [,3]
## [1,]    1    2    3
## [2,]    1    2   42
```

#### 2D, different datatypes: **data.frame**


```r
# data.frame
students <- data.frame(
  name = c("harry", "ron", "cedric"),
  year = c(2, 2, 3),
  alive = c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE), stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)

students
```

```
## # A tibble: 3 x 3
##   name    year alive
##   <chr>  <dbl> <lgl>
## 1 harry      2 TRUE 
## 2 ron        2 TRUE 
## 3 cedric     3 FALSE
```

Useful functions for dataframes


```r
# nrow, ncol, dim
nrow(students)
```

```
## [1] 3
```

```r
ncol(students)
```

```
## [1] 3
```

```r
dim(students)
```

```
## [1] 3 3
```

```r
# parameter stringsAsFactors

# There are many ways to subset data frames
# See if you can find out what each of these lines does

# dollar
students$name
```

```
## [1] "harry"  "ron"    "cedric"
```

```r
# vector
students[1:2]
```

```
## # A tibble: 3 x 2
##   name    year
##   <chr>  <dbl>
## 1 harry      2
## 2 ron        2
## 3 cedric     3
```

```r
students[1, 1]
```

```
## [1] "harry"
```

```r
# character
students["name"]
```

```
## # A tibble: 3 x 1
##   name  
##   <chr> 
## 1 harry 
## 2 ron   
## 3 cedric
```

```r
students$year <- students$year + 3
students
```

```
## # A tibble: 3 x 3
##   name    year alive
##   <chr>  <dbl> <lgl>
## 1 harry      5 TRUE 
## 2 ron        5 TRUE 
## 3 cedric     6 FALSE
```

```r
students <- cbind(students, stuff = c(1,2,3))

students[students$name == "cedric", "year"] <- 8
students[students$alive, ]
```

```
## # A tibble: 2 x 4
##   name   year alive stuff
##   <chr> <dbl> <lgl> <dbl>
## 1 harry     5 TRUE      1
## 2 ron       5 TRUE      2
```

Almost as useful as `?`: the function `str` for _structure_.


```r
str(students)
```

```
## 'data.frame':	3 obs. of  4 variables:
##  $ name : chr  "harry" "ron" "cedric"
##  $ year : num  5 5 8
##  $ alive: logi  TRUE TRUE FALSE
##  $ stuff: num  1 2 3
```

## The first Plots

### Scatterplot


```r
x <- 1:20
y <- x^2
plot(x, y)
```

<img src="01-day1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-56-1.svg" width="672" />


```r
x <- 1:20
y <- x + rnorm(length(x))
plot(x,y)
```

With a linear regression


```r
# model lm
model <- lm(y ~ x)

# plot
plot(x,y, xlab = "This is x", main ="Hello", col = "darkgreen")

# abline
abline(model, col = "red")
```

### The last piechart you will ever need.


```r
cols <- c('#0292D8', '#F7EA39', '#C4B632')
pie(
  c(280, 60, 20),
  init.angle = -50,
  col = cols,
  border = NA, labels = NA
)

legend(1, 1,
       xjust = 0.5,
       yjust = 1,
       fill = cols,
       border = NA,
       legend = c('Sky', 'Sunny side of pyramid', 'Shady side of pyramid')
)
```

### Saving Plots

By executing a piece of code that contains a plot,
the plot is send to a so called `graphics device`.
Think of it as a printer for your plots. By default
this is the plot pane of RStudio (lower right).
If you want to save your base-R plot to a file,
you first open a different graphics device that redirects
your plot for example to a png-file, then run the plot code
and then close the device to finalize the printing step.


```r
png(filename = "myFirstPlot.png")
curve(sin, -5, 5, main = "So much sin!")
dev.off()
```
